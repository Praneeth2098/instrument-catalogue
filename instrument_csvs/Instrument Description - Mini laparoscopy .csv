An 8-inch curved variant is used to access hard-to-reach areas and trim tissues with minimal trauma. They are a standard tool in many surgical specialties,"Metzenbaum scissors are typically made from stainless steel, but different versions are available based on additional features. 
Tungsten Carbide (TC) inserts: Scissors with tungsten carbide inserts offer increased durability and a stronger, longer-lasting cutting edge. These can be identified by their golden ring handles.
Blade tip types: While typically blunt-tipped to reduce accidental trauma, Metzenbaum scissors can also have a sharp/sharp (S/S) or sharp/blunt (S/B) configuration.
Finish: The scissors can come with a matt or polished finish.",,"The 8-inch curved Metzenbaum scissors are a versatile tool used in numerous surgical specialties for precise dissection.
General surgery: The curved design and fine blades allow for accurate cutting and separation of delicate tissues, particularly in confined areas.
Plastic surgery: Used for the careful and precise cutting of soft tissues, ensuring minimal trauma to surrounding areas.
Cardiovascular surgery: These scissors are used for intricate procedures involving blood vessels and other sensitive structures.
ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) procedures: The long shank-to-blade ratio makes them suitable for tonsillectomy and other procedures in deep cavities.",,,,

Blade design: The blades are straight, which gives the user better control for surface-level or linear cuts compared to the curved version.
Tip: It has semi-blunt tips, which helps prevent accidental punctures of underlying tissue.
Strength: The blades and handles are stronger than those of Metzenbaum scissors, making them suitable for cutting tougher materials. ",,"For cutting sutures: The Mayo scissor is a standard ""suture scissor."" The slightly open blades are placed on the suture and slid down to the knot before cutting.
For cutting superficial tissue: In surgeries, the straight blade provides a long cutting surface suitable for tissues that lie flat.
For cutting materials: The robust design is also useful for cutting surgical dressings, meshes, and plastics",,,,
