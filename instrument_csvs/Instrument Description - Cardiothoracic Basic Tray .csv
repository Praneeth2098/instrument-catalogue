"Cardiothoracic Surgery - Cardiothoracic surgery is a surgical subspecialty focused on operating on organs within the chest, primarily the heart, lungs, and esophagus. ","These instruments are used for accessing and manipulating the heart, lungs, and other chest organs during procedures.","Artery Forceps Curved 6""",General,"It is a surgical instrument, also called a hemostat, used to clamp and control blood flow by grasping and compressing blood vessels during medical, veterinary, and laboratory procedures","Structure: An artery forceps consists of two arms that come together to form jaws, designed to grasp and hold tissue or blood vessels. 
Jaws: The jaws are typically serrated, meaning they have ridges that provide a firm, secure grip. Some may also have teeth for extra security. 
Handle: The handle provides a grip for the user to operate the forceps. 
Locking mechanism: Many artery forceps feature a ratchet mechanism that keeps the jaws locked closed once applied, allowing for hands-free hemostasis. ","Straight Forceps: These have straight jaws, used for clamping vessels and tissues in easily accessible areas. 
Curved Forceps: With curved jaws, these provide better maneuverability and access to blood vessels in confined or hard-to-reach spaces. 
","Hemostasis: The primary use is to clamp arteries and veins to control bleeding during surgery, maintaining a clear surgical field. 
Grasping Tissues: They can also be used to grasp and manipulate tissues, sutures, and other prosthetic materials. 
Ligation: After clamping a vessel, the forceps hold it in place for ligation (tying it off), which permanently stops blood flow. 
Dissection: Some forceps, like Adson forceps, are used for delicate dissection and to provide a clear view of the surgical site","Tissue Damage: As forceps are crushing instruments, proper technique and appropriate forceps size are crucial to avoid damaging delicate tissues. 
Application: The choice between straight or curved forceps, and their size, depends on the location and type of structure being addressed. ","Pre-cleaning: Clean the instrument immediately after use to prevent the drying of biological matter. 
Solution: Use a neutral pH (pH 7) cleaning solution for manual or ultrasonic cleaning. 
Process: Clean the retractor in its open position to ensure thorough and effective cleaning of all parts. 
Tools: Use soft cloths, soft plastic brushes made of nylon, or water spray guns for cleaning. 
Drying: Dry instruments completely before sterilization or storage to prevent rust and microbial growth","Lubrication 
Frequency: Lubricate the movable and jointed parts of the retractor once a month.
Lubricant: Use a high-quality, surgical-grade instrument lubricant; do not use industrial oils.
Application: Ensure the lubricant reaches all moving parts for smooth operation and to prevent seizing.
Storage 
Environment: Store surgical instruments in a dry, clean environment.
Protection: Seal away instruments to prevent exposure to moisture, which can lead to oxidation and rust.
Inspection: Before use, visually inspect the retractor for any signs of corrosion, damage, or wear.",

Reversible, sliding hooks: The hooks can be repositioned and reversed to provide optimal access and exposure, depending on the anatomical needs of the patient. They are inserted under the sternum to lift and retract the rib cage.
Construction: The tool is made from high-grade surgical stainless steel, ensuring its durability, resistance to corrosion, and suitability for repeated sterilization.
Ergonomics: The design provides stable retraction and frees the surgeon's hands, which improves efficiency during delicate procedures. ",,"Placement: The hooks of the retractor are carefully placed under the sternum on either side.
Expansion: The surgeon uses a screw-driven or ratcheted mechanism to expand the retractor. This gently lifts the chest wall and spreads the ribs.
Adjustment: The sliding, reversible hooks can be independently adjusted along a horizontal bar to customize the retraction for the specific patient and surgical requirements.
Harvesting: With the chest wall safely and steadily retracted, the surgeon has clear access to harvest the internal mammary artery for use in a bypass graft. ",,,,
