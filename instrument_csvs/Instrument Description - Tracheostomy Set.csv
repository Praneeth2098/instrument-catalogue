,,"Dissecting Forceps, Non-Toothed, 6""    ",General,"A non-toothed, 6-inch dissecting forceps is a handheld surgical tool used for gently grasping, holding, and manipulating delicate tissues during medical and laboratory procedures. The smooth, serrated jaws allow for a secure hold without crushing, puncturing, or causing other trauma to fine structures.","Jaws: The gripping tips of the forceps, which are smooth and typically have fine, transverse serrations on the inner surface. This design provides a firm, atraumatic grasp.
Handles: The handles are designed for manual use with the thumb and index finger, much like tweezers. They are made with a spring action that allows the jaws to open when released and close when squeezed.
Length: The 6-inch length is a versatile size that offers a balance between control and reach for a variety of tasks.",,"This type of forceps is essential for procedures that require a gentle, secure grip. They are often used alongside other surgical tools, such as toothed forceps (for tougher tissue) and scissors. 
Common applications include: 
Tissue dissection: Separating and manipulating delicate, superficial, or fine tissues during a surgical procedure.
Suture handling: Holding and guiding sutures while a surgeon ties knots.
Dressing wounds: Placing or removing surgical dressings without using hands, which helps maintain sterility.
Exploratory surgery: Gently moving tissues out of the way to expose underlying structures.
Laboratory work: Handling specimens and other fine objects in a lab environment, including dissection for educational or research purposes.
Skin manipulation: Some surgeons prefer non-toothed forceps for everting skin edges during closure because they are less traumatic than toothed versions. ",,"Pre-cleaning: Immediately after use, remove gross debris from the spatula to prevent drying of biological materials. 
Manual Cleaning: Use a soft brush and a neutral detergent to carefully clean all surfaces, paying attention to grooves and crevices. Rinse thoroughly with distilled water to remove all traces of the detergent. 
Disinfection: Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific disinfection process, which may involve an enzymatic cleaner or a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for a short contact time. 
Rinse: Ensure the instrument is thoroughly rinsed after disinfection                                                                                                                                                                           Drying: After sterilization, dry the instrument completely to prevent water spots or corrosion.                                                                                                                                     Autoclaving: Malleable retractors are typically designed for autoclaving (steam sterilization). Follow established protocols for steam sterilization at the correct temperature and pressure for the appropriate duration to ensure effective sterilization.                                    ","Storage: Store the sterilized spatula in a dry, dust-free environment. Use appropriate instrument trays or pouches to protect its shape and prevent damage. 
Regular Inspection: Before each use, inspect the spatula for any signs of damage, such as bends, cracks, or corrosion. Do not use a damaged instrument. 
Corrosion Prevention: For copper-based retractors, avoid prolonged exposure to acids or harsh chemicals that can lead to corrosion. Ensure that all cleaning agents are compatible with the material. ",

As a self-retaining retractor, it has a ratchet lock that holds the prongs open, freeing the surgeon's hands","Self-retaining mechanism: It features a ratchet lock that secures the instrument in place, ensuring continuous and stable tissue retraction.
6-inch length: This overall length provides an optimal reach for accessing the surgical site behind the ear.
Curved blades and shanks: The instrument's shape is contoured to fit around the mastoid process and retract tissue with minimal trauma.
Prongs: The blades have outward-curving prongs that interdigitate (fit together) when the instrument is closed. The number of prongs varies by design, such as 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4, and they can be either sharp or blunt depending on the tissue type.
Material: The retractor is made from high-quality, reusable stainless steel that can be sterilized.",,"Purpose: The retractor is designed to hold back soft tissues and muscle to expose the surgical field during mastoidectomies and other related surgeries. Application: While commonly used in ENT, this versatile tool is also suitable for some general, neurological, and orthopedic surgeries",,"Pre-cleaning: Immediately after use, remove gross debris from the spatula to prevent drying of biological materials.

,,"Volkmann (Rake) Retractor 4Prongs, Blunt  8 3/4""",,"A Volkmann (Rake) retractor with 4 prongs, blunt, and an 8 3/4-inch length is a handheld surgical instrument used to hold back or retract superficial tissues. The specific features—rake design, number of prongs, blunt tips, and length—are chosen based on the surgical procedure and the type of tissue involved. ","Volkmann Rake design: Named after German surgeon Richard von Volkmann, this retractor has multiple prongs resembling a small rake. This design allows it to retract a wider area of tissue than single-pronged hooks.
4 blunt prongs: The four blunt tips minimize trauma to the tissue being held or pulled back. This is important for delicate procedures or when a less aggressive hold is needed compared to a sharp version.
8 3/4"" length: This indicates the instrument's total length, which is equivalent to approximately 22 cm. This length provides reach for general and small-bone procedures.
Handheld: The retractor is manually operated, requiring a surgeon or assistant to hold it in place throughout the procedure.
Material: It is typically made from surgical-grade stainless steel, making it durable, rust-resistant, and suitable for repeated sterilization.
Handle: The handle is designed for an ergonomic and secure grip. ",,"The Volkmann retractor is a versatile tool used in various surgical specialties where the retraction of superficial tissue is necessary to provide a clear view of the operating site. 
Orthopedic surgery: Used to retract soft tissues and muscle to expose joints and bones, particularly in procedures involving small bones.
General surgery: Used to hold back the skin and subcutaneous tissue around an incision.
Plastic surgery: Helps provide good visibility during various soft tissue procedures.
Other specialties: Also used in podiatry, hand and foot surgery, and other procedures where tissue needs to be manipulated in small or shallow surgical sites",,"Pre-cleaning: Immediately after use, remove gross debris from the spatula to prevent drying of biological materials.
