,,"Stille Bone Rongeur Compound Action,  Angled 8mm  Bite 9""",,"A Stille bone rongeur is a specialized double-action surgical instrument used for cutting and removing bone during orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures. The description ""C/A Angled 8mm Bite 9"""" refers to the following specific characteristics","Stille: A prominent manufacturer of surgical instruments, known for quality and design. The name may also refer to the ""Stille-Luer"" or ""Stille-Ruskin"" types of rongeurs, which are common designs.
Bone Rongeur: A type of forceps with a heavy-duty, scooped tip designed to bite into and nibble away bone.
C/A: An acronym for ""Compound Action,"" which refers to the rongeur's dual-hinge mechanism. This design increases cutting power and requires less effort from the surgeon, providing greater precision.
Angled: The instrument's jaw is angled relative to the handle, which allows surgeons to access hard-to-reach areas during complex procedures, such as spinal or cranial surgery.
8mm Bite: This is the width of the instrument's jaws, which determines the amount of bone that can be removed with each cut. An 8mm bite is a common size for orthopedic applications.
9"": The overall length of the instrument, measured in inches. This length, which is approximately 23 cm, provides good reach for a variety of surgical sites. ",,"Neurosurgery: Used to remove small pieces of skull to create a ""window"" for accessing the brain or to remove bony tissue around the spinal cord.
Orthopedic surgery: Utilized for trimming and removing bone in confined areas like joints.
Spinal procedures: Crucial for removing vertebrae or bony tissue during spinal decompression surgeries.",,"Pre-cleaning: Clean the instrument immediately after use to prevent the drying of biological matter.
