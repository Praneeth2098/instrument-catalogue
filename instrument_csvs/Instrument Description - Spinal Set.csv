Orthopedic Surgery,"These instruments provide stability, correct malalignment, and facilitate fusion in the spine.","Cushing IVD Rongeur Shaft 7"" 3mm Down",,"a specialized surgical instrument used in neurosurgery and spinal procedures. The description specifies its brand, use, size, and jaw angle.","Cushing IVD Rongeur: A type of surgical rongeur used specifically for working on intervertebral discs (IVD), which are the cushions between spinal vertebrae. The instrument is designed to remove small fragments of bone or fibrocartilaginous material from the spinal column.
Shaft 7"": The shaft, or the body of the instrument, has a working length of 7 inches, or approximately 178 mm.
3mm bite down: This refers to the jaw size and angle.
3mm bite: The jaws are 3mm wide at the tip. In some contexts, the bite may also be described as 3 x 10mm, with 10mm being the length of the jaw.
Down: The jaw is angled downwards. This profile is used to access narrow spaces during procedures and allows for a different approach than a straight or upward-angled jaw. ",,"This rongeur is used in procedures such as:
Discectomy: The surgical removal of a damaged or herniated intervertebral disc.
Laminectomy: The removal of a small portion of the lamina (the vertebral bone) to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves.
Spinal decompression: Removing bone to create more space for the spinal cord and nerves.",,,,

,,"Cushing IVD Rongeur Shaft 7"" 3mm Up",,"Cushing IVD Rongeur: A type of rongeur named after Harvey Cushing, a pioneering neurosurgeon. A rongeur is a plier-like instrument with a strong, sharp-edged, scoop-shaped tip for gouging or biting away bone and tough tissue. ""IVD"" refers to Intervertebral Disc, the primary surgical target for this tool.","Shaft 7"": The shaft, or working length, of the instrument is 7 inches long.
3mm: This specifies the width of the jaws at the tip. The instrument is also available in different jaw sizes.
Up: The instrument has an upward-angled tip, which gives the surgeon better access and manual control during a procedure. ",,"Disc herniation surgery (discectomy): Used to remove herniated or degenerated disc material.
Laminectomy: Used to remove small pieces of bone from the lamina of a vertebra.
Debridement: Removes tough tissue or small pieces of bone from the surgical site",,,,

Grade: Premium OR / A Grade
Shape: Straight jaw profile
Jaw size: 3mm bite width

,,"Kerrison Punch Shaft 7 1/2"" 3mm up 40º.",,"A Kerrison Punch with a 7.5-inch shaft, 3mm bite, and 40° upward-angled jaw is a specialized surgical tool primarily used for precisely removing bone and soft tissue. This specific configuration is commonly used in neurosurgery and spinal procedures where a longer shaft and an upward angle are necessary to reach deep or narrow areas. Several suppliers offer products matching these specifications",,,,"The combination of a long shaft, upward-biting angle, and specific bite size allows for precise bone removal in difficult-to-access areas. 
Neurosurgery: Kerrison punches are used for cranial surgeries like craniotomies and cranioplasties to create access to the brain.
Spinal surgeries: This includes procedures such as laminectomies (removal of the lamina), discectomies (removal of part of a herniated disc), and spinal fusions (stabilizing the vertebrae).
Decompression surgeries: The punch helps relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves by removing small pieces of bone",,,
