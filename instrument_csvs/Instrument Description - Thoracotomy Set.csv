,,"Bailey Rib Contractor , Adult ",Special,"A Bailey rib contractor for adults is a surgical instrument used to approximate, or bring together, the ribs during a procedure like a thoracotomy. After the surgeon has made an incision in the chest wall, the tool's claw tips grasp the ribs and hold them securely in place to allow for suturing and wound closure.","Design: The contractor has two hinged claw-like blades designed to grip the adjacent ribs.
Blades: Each blade typically has two or three sharp tips to ensure a secure grip and prevent slippage during suturing, while the smooth outer edges protect surrounding soft tissue.
Locking mechanism: A screw lock or ratchet mechanism on the handle holds the blades in place once the desired approximation is achieved. This reduces user fatigue and maintains stability throughout the procedure.
Size: An adult-sized Bailey rib contractor is generally longer than the pediatric version, with an overall length of about 19.5 to 20 centimeters (7.75 to 8 inches).
Material: It is made from high-quality, corrosion-resistant surgical-grade stainless steel, ensuring durability and the ability to be sterilized for reuse","Also called a"" Rib Approximator ""","The instrument's primary function is to contract and hold the ribs together following a thoracotomy, a surgical procedure that involves opening the chest cavity.
