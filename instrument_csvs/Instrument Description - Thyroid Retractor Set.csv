Design: It is generally a semicircular instrument featuring a fluted handle and two hinged ""pincher"" blades.
Blades: The fine, angled blades typically have sharp, clip-like ends to securely grasp tissue.",,"The primary application of the Jolls retractor is during thyroid and parathyroid surgeries, where it is used to:
Retract skin and muscle flaps to provide clear, hands-free visualization of the thyroid gland.
