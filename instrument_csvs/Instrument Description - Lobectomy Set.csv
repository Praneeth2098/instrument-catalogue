Jaws: The inside of the jaws typically features serrations or cross-serrations that enhance the grip on tissue or blood vessels, preventing slippage during procedures.
Locking mechanism: These forceps have a ratcheted handle that allows them to be securely locked in place once they have clamped down, freeing the surgeon's hand.",,Mixter forceps are primarily used as hemostats for clamping blood vessels but can also be used for dissecting and grasping tissue during a variety of surgical procedures,,"They are constructed from high-grade stainless steel, which makes them durable, corrosion-resistant, and reusable after sterilization through autoclaving",,

It is also known as the Price-Thomas Bronchus Clamp","Design: The clamp is a scissor-like, hand-held instrument with finger-ring handles and a ratchet mechanism to provide a self-retaining, secure grip.
Jaws: It has long, double-angled jaws with round, blunt edges and longitudinal serrations to provide an atraumatic grip that fits the anatomy of the bronchus. Some models also feature pins on one jaw to further secure the tissue.
Length: An 8 3/4"" (22 cm or 225 mm) overall length is commonly available.",,,,"It is typically made from high-quality, surgical-grade stainless steel, ensuring durability and corrosion resistance after repeated sterilization.",,

The fine, serrated jaws minimize damage to delicate tissue, while the length allows for use in deep surgical cavities. ","Material: High-grade surgical stainless steel, which is durable, corrosion-resistant, and autoclavable.
Jaw style: The 2mm jaws feature fine, atraumatic serrations to provide a secure, non-slip grip on delicate tissues with minimal trauma.
Length: The 9 1/2"" (approx. 24.1 cm) length is a standard size, ideal for reaching deeper surgical fields.
Jaw profile: The jaws can be either straight or angled, with straight jaws being a common configuration for this size.",,"Intended use: These forceps are a key tool in vascular and cardiovascular surgery for handling delicate structures like arteries and veins. They can also be used in microvascular and other general surgical procedures where precise tissue handling is required.
Minimal tissue trauma: The fine, 1x2 row serration pattern is designed to distribute grasping pressure evenly across the tissue, preventing crushing and minimizing trauma.
High precision: The delicate tips and ergonomic design allow for fine-motor control, which is essential for complex procedures.
Ergonomic handle: The ribbed, spring-action handle provides a comfortable and secure grip, which helps reduce hand fatigue during long surgical procedures. ",,,,

A straight 8-inch model is a larger version of this instrument, designed for deep or larger surgical fields.","Self-retaining mechanism: The retractor uses a cam ratchet lock to hold the blades open to the desired width, freeing the surgeon's hands for other tasks.
Ring handles: These provide the surgeon with a comfortable and secure grip on the instrument.
Straight shanks and arms: The 8-inch straight configuration is designed for use in deeper surgical cavities or where broader retraction is needed.
Blades with prongs: The blades, typically in a 3x4 configuration (3 prongs on one side, 4 on the other), have outward-curving teeth that interdigitate when closed. The prongs can be either sharp or blunt, depending on the specific application.
Material: Made from surgical-grade stainless steel, the instrument is durable, corrosion-resistant, and can be sterilized for repeated ",,"The Weitlaner retractor is a versatile instrument used in a variety of surgical procedures, including: 
General surgery: For retracting shallow incisions.
Orthopedic surgery: In procedures involving bones and joints.
Neurosurgery: Such as during a craniotomy to hold back the scalp.
Vascular surgery: Used for procedures like a femoropopliteal bypass.
Plastic surgery: For skin and soft tissue procedures.
Mastoid surgery: Including mastoidectomy, to retract tissue near the ear. ",,,,
