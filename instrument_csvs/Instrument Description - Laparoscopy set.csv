General Surgery,"They are used for minimally invasive surgery, allowing surgeons to visualize and operate within the body through small incisions. ","Sponge Holding Forceps 10""",General,"These are surgical instruments with looped, serrated jaws and a ratchet mechanism that are used to firmly grasp and hold surgical sponges or swabs, and for manipulating tissues.","""Jaws: The forceps feature looped, serrated, or sometimes fenestrated jaws designed to securely hold soft materials like surgical sponges without damaging them. 
Ratchet Mechanism: A locking ratchet on the handles allows the surgeon to maintain a secure, firm grip on the held sponge. 
Material: They are typically made of medical-grade surgical stainless steel for durability and to ensure they can be sterilized and reused safely. 
Shape and Size: Sponge holding forceps are available in various lengths and can be straight or curved to suit different surgical procedures and access to surgical sites. """,,"""Absorption and Hemostasis: They hold sponges to absorb excess blood and fluids from the surgical area, contributing to a clear surgical field. 
Tissue Manipulation and Protection: The forceps can be used to retract or hold back soft tissues, helping the surgeon to access deeper areas or to protect delicate tissues during a procedure. 
Medication Application: Surgeons may use the forceps to apply topical medications or antiseptics to the surgical site. 
Suturing Assistance: They can stabilize a needle for suturing, providing a more secure grip for accurate stitch placement. 
Wound Packing: Forceps are also employed for packing dressings or gauze into surgical wounds. ",,"""Pre-cleaning: Clean the instrument immediately after use to prevent the drying of biological matter. 
Solution: Use a neutral pH (pH 7) cleaning solution for manual or ultrasonic cleaning. 
Process: Clean the retractor in its open position to ensure thorough and effective cleaning of all parts.
