      "brief": "A double hook retractor is a surgical instrument used to retract, hold back, and manipulate soft tissues to give a surgeon a clearer view and better access to the surgical site. It features two hooked arms, which can be located on the same end or on opposite ends of the instrument. During a procedure, a surgeon or an assistant uses the double hook retractor by inserting the hooked tip into the tissue. The instrument is then used to pull the tissue back and away from the surgical field, providing a clear and unobstructed view. The double-hook design allows for more effective retraction by pulling tissue from two points, offering enhanced control and stability.",
      "description": "Double-ended or single-ended: Retractors can have hooks on one end or two, providing versatility for different surgical needs. Some versions, like the Cat's Paw or Kilner retractor, are double-ended with two different sized hook patterns. Sharp or blunt hooks: Depending on the type of tissue and the procedure, the hooks can be either sharp for delicate tissue or blunt for more robust retraction. Material: They are typically made from high-quality, reusable stainless steel, which is durable, resistant to corrosion, and can be repeatedly sterilized. Ergonomic handle: The handle is designed to provide a comfortable, secure grip, which helps reduce hand fatigue during long procedures. Various sizes: The instrument is available in a variety of sizes and lengths to accommodate different surgical procedures and depths.",
      "type": "",
      "usage": "Plastic surgery: Used for retracting skin and delicate soft tissues during procedures like facelifts, skin grafts, and other reconstructions. Orthopedic surgery: Useful in fine work on small joints, such as those in the hands, feet, and ankles. ENT surgery: A \"tracheal double hook\" is specifically used to retract the trachea and surrounding soft tissue during procedures like tracheostomies and laryngectomies. General surgery: Can assist in various procedures that require the retraction of skin, fascia, and other superficial tissues. Ophthalmology: The tiny hooks on some models are helpful for fine work in procedures involving the eyes.",

      "brief": "A Volkmann (Rake) retractor with 4 prongs, blunt, and an 8 3/4-inch length is a handheld surgical instrument used to hold back or retract superficial tissues. The specific features—rake design, number of prongs, blunt tips, and length—are chosen based on the surgical procedure and the type of tissue involved.",
      "description": "Volkmann Rake design: Named after German surgeon Richard von Volkmann, this retractor has multiple prongs resembling a small rake. This design allows it to retract a wider area of tissue than single-pronged hooks. 4 blunt prongs: The four blunt tips minimize trauma to the tissue being held or pulled back. This is important for delicate procedures or when a less aggressive hold is needed compared to a sharp version. 8 3/4\" length: This indicates the instrument's total length, which is equivalent to approximately 22 cm. This length provides reach for general and small-bone procedures. Handheld: The retractor is manually operated, requiring a surgeon or assistant to hold it in place throughout the procedure. Material: It is typically made from surgical-grade stainless steel, making it durable, rust-resistant, and suitable for repeated sterilization. Handle: The handle is designed for an ergonomic and secure grip.",
      "type": "",
      "usage": "The Volkmann retractor is a versatile tool used in various surgical specialties where the retraction of superficial tissue is necessary to provide a clear view of the operating site. Orthopedic surgery: Used to retract soft tissues and muscle to expose joints and bones, particularly in procedures involving small bones. General surgery: Used to hold back the skin and subcutaneous tissue around an incision. Plastic surgery: Helps provide good visibility during various soft tissue procedures. Other specialties: Also used in podiatry, hand and foot surgery, and other procedures where tissue needs to be manipulated in small or shallow surgical sites",
      "importantConsiderations": "",
      "cleaningSterilization": "Pre-cleaning: Immediately after use, remove gross debris from the spatula to prevent drying of biological materials. Manual Cleaning: Use a soft brush and a neutral detergent to carefully clean all surfaces, paying attention to grooves and crevices. Rinse thoroughly with distilled water to remove all traces of the detergent. Disinfection: Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific disinfection process, which may involve an enzymatic cleaner or a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for a short contact time. Rinse: Ensure the instrument is thoroughly rinsed after disinfection Drying: After sterilization, dry the instrument completely to prevent water spots or corrosion. Autoclaving: Malleable retractors are typically designed for autoclaving (steam sterilization). Follow established protocols for steam sterilization at the correct temperature and pressure for the appropriate duration to ensure effective sterilization.",
      "inspectionMaintenance": "Storage: Store the sterilized spatula in a dry, dust-free environment. Use appropriate instrument trays or pouches to protect its shape and prevent damage. Regular Inspection: Before each use, inspect the spatula for any signs of damage, such as bends, cracks, or corrosion. Do not use a damaged instrument. Corrosion Prevention: For copper-based retractors, avoid prolonged exposure to acids or harsh chemicals that can lead to corrosion. Ensure that all cleaning agents are compatible with the material.",
